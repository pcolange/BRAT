# BRAT, a rodent inspired distortion pedal.

## TODO list
- I left out an ON/OFF (power) switch, a common feature in other plugins. It might be a nice touch to add one at some point.
- Add skew for the tone knob despite the circuit showing a linear pot
- Slew rate distortion is commented for now but really should be added back in at some point. I was noticing some artifacts that needed attention.
